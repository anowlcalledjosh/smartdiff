# smartdiff

smartdiff is a program to monitor SMART data over time (for example, the
number of reallocated sectors, the number of unrecoverable errors, and
the amount of data written to the drive). The exact data available will
depend on your drive.

## Installation

smartdiff is a short shell script; you can download the file and place
it in your `$PATH`, or clone the repository and run `sudo make install`
to place it in `/usr/local`.

In terms of dependencies, smartdiff requires the following:

- a POSIX-compliant shell and POSIX utilities
- a `date` that supports the `--iso-8601` option
- the `column` utility
- smartmontools
- git

On a standard Debian-based system, installing the `smartmontools` and
`git` packages should be sufficient.

## Usage

As root, run smartdiff with the disk you would like to monitor. On the
first run, the output will look slightly odd, as there is no previous
state to compare with; on all subsequent runs, any changes to SMART data
will be highlighted.

An example:

```
$ sudo smartdiff /dev/sda

As smartmontools does not (and cannot) contain a comprehensive database
of attribute names, smartdiff comes with several additional attribute
names that will be automatically inserted into the output if your
version of smartmontools does not know about an attribute that your
drive reports (note, attributes differ between drives, so smartdiff's
idea of what an attribute is may not be accurate for your drive).

## Limitations

Due to the ad-hoc nature of SMART data, there may be attributes that
smartdiff and smartmontools have different names for, or attributes that
neither of them know about. If you encounter one of these and you know
what the attribute means, please contribute it to smartmontools itself.

smartdiff was written for the author's own use, and is tuned to work
with their specific drive. It may not work, or may work incorrectly,
when used with other drives.
